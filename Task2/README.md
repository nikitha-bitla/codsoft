# Nikitha Landing Page

This project is a simple and responsive landing page created as part of the CodSoft Web Development Internship (Level 1: Task 2). The page demonstrates fundamental HTML and CSS skills to design a functional and visually appealing web layout.

## Features
- **Responsive Header:** Contains a title and navigation menu with links to different sections.
- **Hero Section:** Highlights the core message of the page with a background image, a title, a description, and a call-to-action button.
- **Footer:** Displays copyright information and ownership details.

## Files Included
1. `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure of the landing page.
2. `styles.css` - Contains the CSS styles used to enhance the design.

## Getting Started
